# Taxonomy Import and Export in OpenOlat

Here you will find general information on how to use the exported and imported files.

## General information

The downloaded .zip file contains two structures: 
An Excel file containing the taxonomy level structure and metadata, and a folder structure containing the media files.

The Excel file is the levels of the taxonomy structure. If you want to rename some structures, you can do so in the table file.

The folder structure is for uploading and sharing images only.

## Adding taxonomy structures to an existing taxonomy

## To import media files

Open the "Taxonomy" menu and click on "Import taxonomy structures". You will need to upload the folder structure as a .zip in the area provided. After you have made one step further, OpenOlat checks whether the media are in the right place.

### Adding to existing taxonomy levels

Export the taxonomy and use the folder structure provided to add images to existing taxonomy levels.
Place only 1 image in the appropriate "Background" or "Teaser" folders.
Do not rename the folder structure.

### Add images to new taxonomy levels

If you want to add images to new taxonomy levels, you must also add the parent folders and the "background" and "teaser" folders for the images.

> Example: *Adding a new taxonomy structure "SUBJECTS/BIO" to the taxonomy Excel table. The next step is to create a folder for "SUBJECTS" and a sub-folder "BIO" with the folders "teaser" and "background" into which I can insert the desired images.

### Image sizes

Teaser images should be 240x100px and have a maximum file size of 2.0 MB.
Background images should be 1324x240px and have a maximum file size of 5.0 MB.
